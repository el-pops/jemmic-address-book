Test task for jemmic recruitment 

This is a simple java console application to manage your contacts. 
You can run it by running included jar file. 

The app is a simple java application. While designing it i tried to keep things simple and not include unnecessary dependancies and frameworks like Spring. As it's a console application it's platform dependant and currently only tested on Windows OS. Also as it's a test task and i had a limited time while developing it i did not wrote any tests and commentaries/documentation and also it's still may need some refactoring and redesign.
